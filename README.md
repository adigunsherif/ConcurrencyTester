# ConcurrencyTester

This allows us to test if a web application endpoint behaves as expected with concurrent user.

# Use case
In a case where the wallet balance of a user reduces when he purchases an item on the application, what if the same user logs into multiple devices at the same time and buys the item at the same time? will the users be debited correctly?
